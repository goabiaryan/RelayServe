# Contributing to Relay

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Quick start

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages.
3. Ensure the server still runs:
   - `relayserve`
4. Open a pull request with a short summary and testing notes.

## Development tips

- Keep changes focused and small when possible.
- Prefer readable code over clever code.
- Add small comments only when something is non-obvious.

## Issues and requests

- Use clear titles and include steps to reproduce.
- For feature requests, explain the motivation and the intended behavior.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Harassment or hostile behavior is not tolerated.
